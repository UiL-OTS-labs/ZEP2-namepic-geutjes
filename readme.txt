Experiment:
        Picture Naming

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to test how quickly participants can name
        presented pictures. For each trial a picture is presented on the screen.
        Participant's task is to name each picture. Auto-paced. Output: audio 
        recording.

        This implementation doesn't measure naming latencies. These have to 
        be measured off-line. The script produces a beep at onset of visual 
        stimulus. Experimenter should make sure the participant's speech 
        signal and the beep signal are both fed into the computer.
